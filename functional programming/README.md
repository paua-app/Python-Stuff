 # Functional Programming
 Functional Programming is a programming style focused on recursion and higher-order functions (HOFs).  
 HOFs are defined as functions that take another function as argument or return a function.  
 
 This package deals with small tasks that can be viewed in the file 'tasks.txt'.  
 To avoid conflict with possible built in functions, all modules are called 'my<task>' and all functions recieve the prefix 'my_'.  
 The module 'auxfuncs' contains some simple functions to approximate the Racket syntax, where Racket is a Lisp dialect (old-school Functional Programming language).
 
 To use functions from this package, simply import them directly or the module containing them.  
 As of now, it is not included in Python's 3rd-Party libraries, nor is it planned to be.
